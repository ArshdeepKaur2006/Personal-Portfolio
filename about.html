        <h2>Some Information about me</h2>
       <p>
  My name is Arshdeep Kaur, a student of B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in IoT & Cyber Security. I am passionate about web development and game design. My journey began with basic websites, and over time, I’ve worked on projects like an Amazon Clone, Weather App, and Unity-based games such as Flappy Bird and Cube Runner.

<p>
  I love combining creativity with technology, whether it’s designing engaging UIs or developing game mechanics. I'm constantly learning new tools and improving my skills in frontend development and Unity (C#). I believe in building projects that are both visually appealing and functionally strong.
